Web Scraping is a technique for extracting information and storing data from one or more web pages in an automated way in order to analyze those pages and obtain the data we are interested in extracting.

How we do it? 

Often bots (snippets of programming code) are used that automatically collect specific data from HTML code and/or information stored in the database and then store it wherever we want.

See the code attached

We are going to do as an example a Web Scraping process on the CoinMarketCap website, to obtain the name of the first 10 cryptocurrencies and their corresponding value, which we will then store in a csv file, all automatically.
